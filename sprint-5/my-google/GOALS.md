The purpose of the application is to create a personal website that showcases some of my past projects. The intended audience would be potential employers or anyone who is interested in my software projects. I will be displaying information about myself including a bio, interests, involvement, and projects. I want it to be able to have a showcase of my work and interests for potential employers and I think that the SSO requirements of this assignment will be a good thing to implement in order to get feedback and for people to reach out using their google account.
