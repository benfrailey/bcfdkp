By following the instructions I was able to get the app working without much difficulty. The tutorial was very helpful and so I didn't get stuck at any point. By the end of the semester I hope to hook it up to a personal website that visualizes my resume and past project as well as allowing potential employers to reach out to me for inquiries. The SSO will come in specifically for allowing people to reach out to me and have an authorized email/account that I can see.
