By following the instructions I was able to get the app working without much difficulty. The tutorial was very helpful and so I didn't get stuck at any point with the base setup. I did have trouble trying to combine the static website I had designed with the nonstatic SSO. I was eventually able to figure this out. By the end of the semester I hope to hook it up to a personal website that visualizes my resume and past project as well as allowing potential employers to reach out to me for inquiries. The SSO will come in specifically for allowing people to reach out to me and have an authorized email/account that I can see. As of right now I have the SSO working and have connected it to my website, however I haven't added functionality to reach out to me.
