I ended up looking at OpenID Connect, OAuth, and Sails. While admittedly this is a somewhat arbitrary reason to choose one, I ended up choosing Sails because based on my initial impression it seemed to be the most casual and easu to use. I could be completely mistakren in that, but that was what I based my decision on. Sails proved to be very easy for me to set up, as all I needed to do was install it in terminal and it did most of the work. I got to a point where I have a website with a login page on it. While getting the login apge up and running was fairly simple, I wasn't able to get an SSO login connected with any major sites like facebook or google. This was an obstacle I have yet to figure out how to overcome.
