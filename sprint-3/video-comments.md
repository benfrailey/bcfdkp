At the beginning of the video, they discussed pushing back a meeting because of Easter. They then went into the formal meeting. The first metric that they discussed was a metric that determined the number of inactive contributors on the project. This would determine the amount of contributors that lost interest or otherwise left the project. This can be very helpful in determining the health of the project if a lot of people are leaving. They then talked for awhile about a potential new template for metrics. For the first metric, they thought the objective section was redundant and should be less wordy. They also found some syntax errors that needed to be discussed. The second metric that they discussed was about the length of the code in a project. They discussed whether it should be a part of evolution or it should move to value. They then talked about the potential value that knowing the length of the code could have. They decided that it was a good idea but it needs more work in order to be implemented. While the use case didnâ€™t seem as immediately apparent, they both agreed that it had potential and should continue to be looked at.
