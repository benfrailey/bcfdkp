Requirements for the system:

Should have an algorithm that is able to detect whether or not a repository is healthy.
Should have good visualization software that allows the data to be easily viewable as well as be able to download the data as an image
Should be able to attach other applications to the systems API
Should look similar to Github so that it looks consistent throughout
Python could potentially cause increased response times, however it also has useful libraries that could be implemented
